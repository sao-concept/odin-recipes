        <h2><u>Ingredients</u></h2>

            <h3>For the crepes:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 store-bought or homemade pie crusts</li>   
                </ul>

            <h3>For the filling:</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>2 cups cooked chicken, diced or shredded</li>
                    <li>1 cup carrots, diced</li>
                    <li>1 cup frozen peas</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup celery, diced</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup onion, diced</li>
                    <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
                    <li>1/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
                    <li>2 cups chicken broth</li>
                    <li>1 cup milk or cream</li>
                    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
                    <li>Herbs and seasonings of choice (such as thyme, parsley, or rosemary)</li>
                </ul>

            <h2><u>Steps</u></h2>

                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).</li>
        
                    <li>In a large skillet or pot, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the diced onions, carrots, celery, and any other desired vegetables. Sauté until the vegetables are tender.</li>
                        
                    <li>Stir in the all-purpose flour, coating the vegetables evenly. Cook for about a minute to cook off the raw flour taste.</li>
                        
                    <li>Slowly pour in the chicken broth and milk or cream, stirring constantly. Continue cooking and stirring until the mixture thickens and comes to a simmer. This will create the creamy filling for the pot pie.</li>
                        
                    <li>Add the cooked chicken, peas, and any herbs or seasonings of your choice. Stir to combine and cook for a few more minutes until everything is heated through. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
        
                    <li>Remove the skillet or pot from heat and set it aside to cool slightly.</li>
        
                    <li>Prepare a pie dish or baking dish by lining it with one of the pie crusts.</li>
        
                    <li>Pour the chicken and vegetable filling into the prepared crust.</li>
        
                    <li>Cover the filling with the second pie crust. You can choose to keep it whole, create a lattice pattern, or cut it into shapes for decoration. Seal the edges by crimping them together with a fork.</li>
        
                    <li>Make a few small slits on the top crust to allow steam to escape during baking.</li>
                    
                    <li>Place the pot pie in the preheated oven and bake for approximately 30-35 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbly.</li>

                    <li>Remove the pot pie from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before serving.</li>
                </ol>
