                <li>1/2 cup grated cheese (such as mozzarella, feta, or goat cheese)</li>
                <li>Fresh herbs (such as basil, parsley, or chives), chopped</li>
                <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            </ul>

        <h3>For the sauce (optional):</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Tomato sauce or salsa</li>
                <li>Sour cream or Greek yogurt</li>
            </ul>

    <h2><u>Steps</u></h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the crepe batter:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>In a mixing bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour and salt.</li>
                    <li>In a separate bowl, beat the eggs, then add the milk and melted butter. Whisk until well combined.</li>
                    <li>Gradually pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients while whisking continuously until you have a smooth batter.</li>
                    <li>Set aside to rest for 10-15 minutes.</li>
                </ul>

            <li>Prepare the squash blossom filling:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Gently remove the stamen or pistil from each squash blossom.</li>
                    <li>Rinse the blossoms under cold water to remove any dirt or debris. Pat them dry with a paper towel.</li>
                    <li>In a separate bowl, mix together the grated cheese, chopped herbs, salt, and pepper.</li>
                    <li>Carefully stuff each squash blossom with a small amount of the cheese and herb mixture. Twist the petals gently to seal the filling inside.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Cook the crepes:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Heat a non-stick skillet or crepe pan over medium heat. Lightly grease the pan with butter or cooking spray.</li>
                    <li>Pour a small ladleful of the crepe batter into the pan, swirling it around to spread it evenly.</li>
                    <li>Cook for about 1-2 minutes or until the edges start to lift and the bottom is lightly golden. Flip the crepe using a spatula and cook for another 1-2 minutes on the other side.</li>
                    <li>Transfer the cooked crepe to a plate and repeat the process with the remaining batter.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Assemble the crepes:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Take a cooked crepe and place a stuffed squash blossom in the center. Fold the sides of the crepe over the blossom to enclose it.</li>
                    <li>Repeat with the remaining crepes and squash blossoms.</li>
                </ul>
            <li>Serve:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Place the filled crepes on a serving platter.</li>
                    <li>Optionally, you can serve the crepes with a side of tomato sauce or salsa and a dollop of sour cream or Greek yogurt.</li>
                    <li>Garnish with additional chopped herbs, if desired.</li>
                </ul>
        </ol>
