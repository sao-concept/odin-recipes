        <h2><u>Ingredients</u></h2>

            <li>1 pound thinly sliced roast beef</li>   
            <li>4-6 crusty French rolls or baguettes</li>
            <li>8-12 slices of provolone or Swiss cheese</li>
            <li>1 onion, thinly sliced</li>
            <li>4 cups beef broth</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>   
            <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
            <li>Butter or oil for sautéing</li>
        </ul>

        <h2><u>Steps</u></h2>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 350°F (175°C).</li>

            <li>In a saucepan, heat some butter or oil over medium heat. Add the sliced onions and sauté until they become soft and caramelized.</li>
                
            <li>In a separate saucepan, combine the beef broth, minced garlic, and Worcestershire sauce. Bring the mixture to a simmer and let it cook for a few minutes to allow the flavors to meld together. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                
            <li>Split the French rolls or baguettes lengthwise and lay them on a baking sheet. If desired, lightly toast them in the preheated oven for a few minutes.</li>
                
            <li>Arrange the thinly sliced roast beef on one side of each roll. Top the roast beef with slices of provolone or Swiss cheese.</li>

            <li>Place the sandwich halves back in the oven to melt the cheese. Bake for about 5 minutes or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>

            <li>Once the cheese has melted, remove the sandwich halves from the oven and carefully press the top and bottom halves together.</li>

            <li>Slice the sandwiches into individual servings.</li>

            <li>Serve the French Dip Sandwiches with small bowls of the warm au jus sauce for dipping.</li>

            <li>Enjoy your Easy French Dip Sandwiches while they are still warm and the cheese is gooey.</li>
        </ol>
